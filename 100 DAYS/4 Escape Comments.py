'''Python Comments'''
    # A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute, rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of code while testing.

# To write a comment just add a ‘#’ at the start of the line.
# To write multi-line comments you can use ‘#’ at each line or you can use the multiline string.


'''Escape Sequence Characters'''
    # To insert characters that cannot be directly used in a string, we use an escape sequence character.
    # An escape sequence character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
    # An example of a character that cannot be directly used in a string is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
